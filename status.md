Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a website using HTML and made it visually appealing using CSS. I linked the thumbnails and labels to external websites. I tired to figure out how to embed them, but I could not figure it out and was running out of time.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have only added 10 games so far and plan to add at least 5 more.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I forgot to add the project to GitHub from the start, but I have successfully done that now, after writing the code. Also, when I was trying to embed the games to the website, I was looking to learn java to code the game, but it was too complicated for me, and I kept getting super confused and having to restart. I was running out of time, and this is why I added links to external websites.
