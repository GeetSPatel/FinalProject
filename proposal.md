# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Video Game Website

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website with old games for the user the play.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan to create a website using HTML and CSS. On that website I plan to create games like Snake, Sudoku, and Minesweeper. I will aim to embed the games into the code rather than simply link it to other sites.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

At the very least, I will create a website using HTML and CSS. On that website I will include games, and they will be linked to external sites that already has the game at the very least.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can definately code at least one game by myself on the website. If I can't get all three games coded, I will link the others.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will create the website and code snake, minesweeper, and Sudoku.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

To begin, I will start learning HTML and CSS to create a basic website and make it visually apealing. I will then learn how to embed games on the website and add them to the original website in a way that is asthetically pleasing.
